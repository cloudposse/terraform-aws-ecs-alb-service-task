[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-alb-service-task/releases).



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete)

```hcl
module "label" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-terraform-label.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "staging"
  name      = "app"
}

module "container_definition" {
  source          = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition.git?ref=master"
  container_name  = "app"
  container_image = "cloudposse/geodesic:latest"

  environment = [
    {
      name  = "string_var"
      value = "I am a string"
    },
    {
      name  = "true_boolean_var"
      value = true
    },
    {
      name  = "false_boolean_var"
      value = false
    },
    {
      name  = "integer_var"
      value = 42
    },
  ]

  port_mappings = [
    {
      containerPort = 8080
      hostPort      = 80
      protocol      = "tcp"
    },
    {
      containerPort = 8081
      hostPort      = 443
      protocol      = "udp"
    },
  ]
}

module "alb_service_task" {
  source                    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-alb-service-task.git?ref=master"
  namespace                 = "eg"
  stage                     = "staging"
  name                      = "app"
  alb_target_group_arn      = "xxxxxxx"
  container_definition_json = "${module.container_definition.json}"
  container_name            = "${module.label.id}"
  ecs_cluster_arn           = "xxxxxxx"
  launch_type               = "FARGATE"
  vpc_id                    = "xxxxxxx"
  security_group_ids        = ["xxxxx", "yyyyy"]
  private_subnet_ids        = ["xxxxx", "yyyyy", "zzzzz"]
}
```

The `container_image` in the `container_definition` module is the Docker image used to start a container.

This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default.
Other repositories are specified with either `repository-url/image:tag` or `repository-url/image@digest`.
Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed.
This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of `docker run`.

When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use.
However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.

Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full `registry/repository:tag` or `registry/repository@digest`.
For example, `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest` or `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE`.

Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, `ubuntu` or `mongo`).

Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, `amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`).

Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, `quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`).

For more info, see [Container Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html).
