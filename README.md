## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-alb-service-task/releases).



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated test of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).

```

The `container_image` in the `container_definition` module is the Docker image used to start a container.

This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default.
Other repositories are specified with either `repository-url/image:tag` or `repository-url/image@digest`.
Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed.
This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of `docker run`.

When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use.
However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.

Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full `registry/repository:tag` or `registry/repository@digest`.
For example, `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest` or `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE`.

Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, `ubuntu` or `mongo`).

Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, `amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`).

Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, `quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`).

For more info, see [Container Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html).
