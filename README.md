Terraform module to create an ECS Service for a web app (task), and an ALB target group to route requests.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

The `container_image` in the `container_definition` module is the Docker image used to start a container.

The `container_definition` is a string of JSON-encoded container definitions. Normally, you would place only one container definition here as the example
above demonstrates. However, there might be situations where more than one container per task is more appropriate such as optionally in
[Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/application_architecture.html#application_architecture_fargate) or in other cases
where sidecars may be required. With [cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition)
multi-container task definitions can be created using:
```hcl
module "ecs_alb_service_task" {
  ...
  container_definition_json = jsonencode([
    module.first_container.json_map_object,
    module.second_container.json_map_object,
  ])
  ...
}
```
Refer to the [multiple definitions](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition/blob/master/examples/multiple_definitions/main.tf) example
in cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition for details on defining multiple definitions.

This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default.
Other repositories are specified with either `repository-url/image:tag` or `repository-url/image@digest`.
Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods, forward slashes, and number signs are allowed.
This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of `docker run`.

When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use.
However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.

Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full `registry/repository:tag` or `registry/repository@digest`.
For example, `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:latest` or `012345678910.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE`.

Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, `ubuntu` or `mongo`).

Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, `amazon/amazon-ecs-agent`).

Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, `quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu`).

For more info, see [Container Definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
